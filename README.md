# A11y Skills

A collection of accessibility-centric skills for AI agents and editors.

## Structure

Core skills are authored in `.claude/` as the current industry standard. Until IDEs align on a common format, use the sync rule to copy skills to your IDE's preferred location:

- **Claude Code**: Skills work natively from `.claude/skills/`
- **Cursor**: Run "sync skills" to copy to `.cursor/skills/` and generate `AGENTS.md`
- **GitHub Copilot**: Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with a dictionary referencing `.claude/skills/` paths

See `AGENTS.md` for an overview of available skills after syncing.
