## Biography

This user works in marketing and uses a screen magnifier to browse dashboards and websites. They get frustrated when text is low contrast or when interactive elements are not clearly distinguishable from regular content.

They have been living with low vision for several years and have become proficient with assistive technologies. They prefer dark themes and high contrast modes when available, and often need to zoom web pages to 200-400% to read comfortably.

When reviewing interfaces, this user looks for:
- Clear visual boundaries between sections
- Sufficient color contrast (at least 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Scalable text that doesn't break layouts when magnified
- Keyboard accessibility as a backup to mouse interactions
