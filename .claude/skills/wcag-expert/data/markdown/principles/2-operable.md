# Principle 2: Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

## Guidelines

- **2.1 Keyboard Accessible**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
- **2.2 Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content.
- **2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions**: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.
- **2.4 Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
- **2.5 Input Modalities**: Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.
