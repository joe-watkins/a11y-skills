# Principle 1: Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

## Guidelines

- **1.1 Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
- **1.2 Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media.
- **1.3 Adaptable**: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
- **1.4 Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
