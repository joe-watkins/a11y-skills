# Idiom

phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of the individual words and
      the specific words cannot be changed without losing the meaning
   

   
   NoteIdioms cannot be translated directly, word for word, without losing their (cultural
      or language-dependent) meaning.
   

   
   Example 1In English, "spilling the beans" means "revealing a secret." However, "knocking over
      the beans" or "spilling the vegetables" does not mean the same thing.
   

   
   Example 2In Japanese, the phrase "さじを投げる" literally translates into "he throws a spoon," but it means that there is nothing
      he can do and finally he gives up.
   

   
   Example 3In Dutch, "Hij ging met de kippen op stok" literally translates into "He went to roost with the chickens," but it means that
      he went to bed early.
