# Captions

synchronized visual and/or [text alternative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text-alternative) for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content
   

   
   Note 1Captions are similar to dialogue-only subtitles except captions convey not only the
      content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information
      needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter,
      speaker identification and location.
   

   
   Note 2Closed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.

   
   Note 3Open Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions
      are visual equivalent [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-images-of-text) embedded in [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-video).
   

   
   Note 4Captions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.

   
   Note 5In some countries, captions are called subtitles.

   
   Note 6[Audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-audio-descriptions) can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information
      that is already presented visually.
