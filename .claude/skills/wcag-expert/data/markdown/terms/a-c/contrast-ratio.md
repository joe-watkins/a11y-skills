# Contrast Ratio

(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where

   
   

      
      - L1 is the [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-relative-luminance) of the lighter of the colors, and
      

      
      - L2 is the [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-relative-luminance) of the darker of the colors.
      

      
   

   
   Note 1Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).

   
   Note 2Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered
      (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be
      evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.
   

   
   Note 3For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect
      to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no
      background color is specified, then white is assumed.
   

   
   Note 4Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered
      in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text
      color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot
      be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
      color is specified when a background color is specified.
   

   
   Note 5When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be
      used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border
      around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that
      fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.
   

   
   Note 6WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that
      an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not
      consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except
      where caused by authors' code.
