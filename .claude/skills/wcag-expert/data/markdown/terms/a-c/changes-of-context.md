# Changes Of Context

major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view
      the entire page simultaneously
   

   
   Changes in context include changes of:

   
   

      
      - [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents);
      

      
      - [viewport](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-viewport);
      

      
      - focus;

      
      - [content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-content) that changes the meaning of the [web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-web-page-s)
      

      
   

   
   NoteA change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as
      an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the
      context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).
   

   
   ExampleOpening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including
      anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly
      re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.
