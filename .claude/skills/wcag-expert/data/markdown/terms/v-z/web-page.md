# Web Page

a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources
      that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents)

   
   Note 1Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource,
      they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.
   

   
   Note 2For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded"
      within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page.
   

   
   Example 1A web resource including all embedded images and media.

   
   Example 2A web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program
      lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area
      and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar
      to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole.
   

   
   Example 3A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of
      different content modules.
   

   
   Example 4When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like
      interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging
      products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of
      you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet
      floating alongside. This might be a single-page website or just one page within a
      website.
