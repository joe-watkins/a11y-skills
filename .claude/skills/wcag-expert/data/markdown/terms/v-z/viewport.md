# Viewport

object in which the [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents) presents content

   
   Note 1The user agent presents content through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames,
      loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport
      (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts,
      menus, and alerts are not viewports.
   

   
   Note 2This definition is based on [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/glossary.html) [[UAAG10](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bib-uaag10)].
