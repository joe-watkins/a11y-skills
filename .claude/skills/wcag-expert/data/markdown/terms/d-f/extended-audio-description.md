# Extended Audio Description

audio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-video) so that there is time to add additional description
   

   
   NoteThis technique is only used when the sense of the [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-video) would be lost without the additional [audio description](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-audio-descriptions) and the pauses between dialogue/narration are too short.
