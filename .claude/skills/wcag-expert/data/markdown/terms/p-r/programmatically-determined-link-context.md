   ExampleIn HTML, information that is programmatically determinable from a link in English
      includes text that is in the same [paragraph](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraph), 
      list item, or table cell as the link or in a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link.

      the current sentence, when the focus is on a link in that sentence.
