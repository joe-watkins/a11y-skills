# Perimeter

continuous line forming the boundary of a shape not including shared pixels, or the [minimum bounding box](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-bounding-boxes), whichever is shortest.

  ExampleThe perimeter calculation for a 2 CSS pixel perimeter around a rectangle is 4*h*+4*w*, where *h* is the height and *w* is the width. For a 2 CSS pixel perimeter around a circle it is 4𝜋*r*.
