# Live

information captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with
      no more than a broadcast delay
   

   
   Note 1A broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order
      to give the broadcaster time to cue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient
      to allow significant editing.
   

   
   Note 2If information is completely computer generated, it is not live.
