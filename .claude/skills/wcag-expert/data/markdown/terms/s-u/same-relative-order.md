# Same Relative Order

same position relative to other items

   
   NoteItems are considered to be in the same relative order even if other items are inserted
      or removed from the original order. For example, expanding navigation menus may insert
      an additional level of detail or a secondary navigation section may be inserted into
      the reading order.
