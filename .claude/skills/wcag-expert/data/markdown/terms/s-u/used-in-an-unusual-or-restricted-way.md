# Used In An Unusual Or Restricted Way

words used in such a way that requires users to know exactly which definition to apply
      in order to understand the content correctly
   

   Example
      The term "gig" means something different if it occurs in a discussion of music concerts
         than it does in article about computer hard drive space, but the appropriate definition
         can be determined from context. By contrast, the word "text" is used in a very specific
         way in WCAG 2, so a definition is supplied in the glossary.
