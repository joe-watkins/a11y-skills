# User Interface Component

a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct
      function
   

   
   Note 1Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element.
      "Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user
      perceives as separate controls.
   

   
   Note 2User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated
      by scripts.
   

   
   Note 3What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes
      called "user interface element".
   

   
   ExampleAn applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by line or page
      or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently,
      they would each be a "user interface component."
