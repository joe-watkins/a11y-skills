# Target

region of the display that will accept a pointer action, such as the interactive area of a [user interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components)

 
    NoteIf two or more targets are overlapping, the overlapping area should not be included in the measurement of the target size, except when the overlapping targets perform the same action or open the same page.
