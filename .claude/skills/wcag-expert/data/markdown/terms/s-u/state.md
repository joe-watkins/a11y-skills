# State

dynamic property expressing characteristics of a [user interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components) that may change in response to user action or automated processes

	States do not affect the nature of the component, but represent data associated with the component or user interaction possibilities. Examples include focus, hover, select, press, check, visited/unvisited, and expand/collapse.
