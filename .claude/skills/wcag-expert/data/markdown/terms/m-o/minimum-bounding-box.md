# Minimum Bounding Box

the smallest enclosing rectangle aligned to the horizontal axis within which all the points of a shape lie. For components which wrap onto multiple lines as part of a sentence or [block of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-blocks-of-text) (such as hypertext links), the bounding box is based on how the component would appear on a single line.
