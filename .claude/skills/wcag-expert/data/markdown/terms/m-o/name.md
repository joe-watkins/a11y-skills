# Name

text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user

   
   Note 1The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a [label](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-labels) is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are
      the same.
   

   
   Note 2This is unrelated to the name attribute in HTML.
