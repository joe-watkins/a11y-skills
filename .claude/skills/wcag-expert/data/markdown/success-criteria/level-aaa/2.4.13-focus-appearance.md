## Full Description

When the keyboard [focus indicator](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-focus-indicator) is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:

    

        - is at least as large as the area of a 2 [CSS pixel](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-css-pixels) thick [perimeter](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-perimeter) of the unfocused component or sub-component, and

        - has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.

    

    Exceptions:

    

        - The focus indicator is determined by the [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents) and cannot be adjusted by the author, or

        - The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.

    

    Note 1What is perceived as the user interface component or sub-component (to determine the perimeter) depends on its visual [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation). The visual presentation includes the component's visible [content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-content), border, and component-specific background. It does not include shadow and glow effects outside the component's content, background, or border.

    Note 2Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu, or focusable cells in a grid.

    Note 3Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the [technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-technologies) (such as HTML, CSS, and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing can be ignored.

## Details

- ****: is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component or sub-component, and
- ****: has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.
- ****: The focus indicator is determined by the user agent and cannot be adjusted by the author, or
- ****: The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Using an author-supplied, visible focus indicator**

**Creating a two-color focus indicator to ensure sufficient contrast with all components**

**Creating a strong focus indicator within the component**


### Common Failures

- **F55**: Failure of Success Criteria 2.1.1, 2.4.7, 2.4.13, and 3.2.1 due to using script to remove focus when focus is received
- **F78**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.11, 2.4.7 and 2.4.13 due to styling element outlines and borders in a way that removes or renders non-visible the visual focus indicator
