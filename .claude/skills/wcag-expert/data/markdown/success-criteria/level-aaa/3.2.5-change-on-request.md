# 3.2.5 Change on Request (Level AAA)

**Guideline**: 3.2 Predictable  
**Principle**: 3 Understandable

## Understanding

Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes.

## Full Description

[Changes of context](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-change-of-context) are initiated only by user request or a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to turn off such changes.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Situation A: If the web page allows automatic updates:**

- **G76**: Providing a mechanism to request an update of the content instead of updating automatically
**Situation B: If automatic redirects are possible:**

- **SVR1**: Implementing automatic redirects on the server side instead of on the client side
- **G110**: Using an instant client-side redirect
**Situation C: If the web page uses pop-up windows:**

- ****: Including pop-up windows
**Situation D: If using an onchange event on a select element:**

- **SCR19**: Using an onchange event on a select element without causing a change of context

### Advisory Techniques

- **G200**: Opening new windows and tabs from a link only when necessary

### Common Failures

- **F60**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to launching a new window when a user enters text into an input field
- **F61**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to complete change of main content through an automatic update that the user cannot disable from within the content
- **F9**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to changing the context when the user removes focus from a form element
- **F22**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to opening windows that are not requested by the user
- **F52**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to opening a new window as soon as a new page is loaded
- **F40**: Failure due to using meta redirect with a time limit
- **F41**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1, 2.2.4, and 3.2.5 due to using meta refresh to reload the page
