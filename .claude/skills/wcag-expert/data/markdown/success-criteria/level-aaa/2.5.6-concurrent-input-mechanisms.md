# 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (Level AAA)

**Guideline**: 2.5 Input Modalities  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is essential, required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect user settings.

## Full Description

Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential), required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect user settings.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Only using high-level, input-agnostic event handlers, such as `focus`, `blur`, `click`, in Javascript (Potential future technique)**

**Registering event handlers for keyboard/keyboard-like and pointer inputs simultaneously in Javascript; see [Example 1 in Pointer Events Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents2/#example_1) (Potential future technique)**


### Common Failures

- **F98**: Failure due to interactions being limited to touch-only on touchscreen devices
