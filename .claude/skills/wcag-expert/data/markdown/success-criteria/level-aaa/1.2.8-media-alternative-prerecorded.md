**Guideline**: 1.2 Time-based Media  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

An alternative for time-based media is provided for all prerecorded synchronized media and for all prerecorded video-only media.

## Full Description

An [alternative for time-based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-alternative-for-time-based-media) is provided for all [prerecorded](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-prerecorded)
      [synchronized media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-synchronized-media) and for all prerecorded [video-only](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-video-only) media.

## Techniques

**Situation B: If the content is prerecorded video-only:**
