# 3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced) (Level AAA)

**Guideline**: 3.3 Input Assistance  
**Principle**: 3 Understandable

## Understanding

A cognitive function test (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step provides at least one of the following:

## Full Description

A [cognitive function test](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-cognitive-function-test) (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes) unless that step provides at least one of the following:

 
    

        **Alternative**: 
        Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.

        **Mechanism**: 
        A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.

## Details

- **Alternative**: Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.
- **Mechanism**: A mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Email link authentication**

**Providing properly marked up email and password inputs**

**Providing WebAuthn as an alternative to username/password (Potential future technique)**

**Providing a third-party login using OAuth (Potential future technique)**

**Using two techniques to provide two-factor authentication (Potential future technique)**


### Common Failures

- **F109**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.3.8 and 3.3.9 due to preventing password or code re-entry in the same format
