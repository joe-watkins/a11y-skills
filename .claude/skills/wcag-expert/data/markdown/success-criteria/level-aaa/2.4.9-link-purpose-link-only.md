# 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) (Level AAA)

**Guideline**: 2.4 Navigable  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

A mechanism is available to allow the purpose of each link to be identified from link text alone, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.

## Full Description

A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to allow the [purpose of each link](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-purpose-of-each-link) to be identified from link text alone,
      except where the purpose of the link would be [ambiguous to users in general](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-ambiguous-to-users-in-general).

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Using aria-label for link purpose**

**Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link**

**Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link for anchor elements**

**Providing text alternatives for the area elements of image maps**

**Allowing the user to choose short or long link text**

**Providing a supplemental description of the purpose of a link**

**Semantically indicating links**


### Advisory Techniques

- **H2**: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource
- **H33**: Supplementing link text with the title attribute

### Common Failures

- **F84**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.9 due to using a non-specific link such as "click here" or "more" without a mechanism to change the link text to specific text.
- **F89**: Failure of Success Criteria 2.4.4, 2.4.9 and 4.1.2 due to not providing an accessible name for an image which is the only content in a link
