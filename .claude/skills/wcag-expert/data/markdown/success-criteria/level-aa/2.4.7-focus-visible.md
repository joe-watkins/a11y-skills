# 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)

**Guideline**: 2.4 Navigable  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.

## Full Description

Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard [focus indicator](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-focus-indicator) is visible.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Using user interface components that are highlighted by the user agent when they receive focus**

**Using CSS to change the presentation of a user interface component when it receives focus**

**Using the default focus indicator for the platform so that high visibility default focus indicators will carry over**

**Using an author-supplied, visible focus indicator**

**Creating a two-color focus indicator to ensure sufficient contrast with all components**

**Using CSS :focus-visible to provide keyboard focus indication**

**Using script to change the background color or border of the element with focus**


### Common Failures

- **F55**: Failure of Success Criteria 2.1.1, 2.4.7, 2.4.13, and 3.2.1 due to using script to remove focus when focus is received
- **F78**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.11, 2.4.7 and 2.4.13 due to styling element outlines and borders in a way that removes or renders non-visible the visual focus indicator
