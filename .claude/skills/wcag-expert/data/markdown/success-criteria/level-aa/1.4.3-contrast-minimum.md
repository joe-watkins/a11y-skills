# 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)

**Guideline**: 1.4 Distinguishable  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:

## Full Description

The visual presentation of [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text) and [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-images-of-text) has a [contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-contrast-ratio) of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:
   

   
   

      
      **Large Text**: 
      
      [Large-scale](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-large-scale) text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
         

         
      

      
      **Incidental**: 
      
      Text or images of text that are part of an inactive [user interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components), that are [pure decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-pure-decoration), that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant
            other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
         

         
      

      
      **Logotypes**: 
      
      Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement.

## Details

- **Large Text**: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
- **Incidental**: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
- **Logotypes**: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Situation A: text is less than 18 point if not bold and less than 14 point if bold**

- **G18**: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text
- **G148**: Not specifying background color, not specifying text color, and not using technology features that change those defaults
- **G174**: Providing a control with a sufficient contrast ratio that allows users to switch to a presentation that uses sufficient contrast
**Situation B: text is at least 18 point if not bold and at least 14 point if bold**

- **G145**: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text
- **G148**: Not specifying background color, not specifying text color, and not using technology features that change those defaults
- **G174**: Providing a control with a sufficient contrast ratio that allows users to switch to a presentation that uses sufficient contrast

### Advisory Techniques

- **G156**: Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that can change the foreground and background of blocks of text

### Common Failures

- **F24**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.3, 1.4.6 and 1.4.8 due to specifying foreground colors without specifying background colors or vice versa
- **F83**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 due to using background images that do not provide sufficient contrast with foreground text (or images of text)
