**Guideline**: 2.5 Input Modalities  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

All functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential or the functionality is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.

## Full Description

All [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-functionality) that uses a [dragging movement](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-dragging-movements) for operation can be achieved by a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) without dragging, unless dragging is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential) or the functionality is determined by the [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents) and not modified by the author.
