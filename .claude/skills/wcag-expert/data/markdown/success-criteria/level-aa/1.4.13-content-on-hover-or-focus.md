# 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (Level AA)

**Guideline**: 1.4 Distinguishable  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:

## Full Description

Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:

  

    **Dismissible**: 
    A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an [input error](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-input-error) or does not obscure or replace other content;

    **Hoverable**: 
   If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved  over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;

    **Persistent**: 
    The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.

  

    	
    	Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents) and is not modified by the author.

    	Note 1Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML `title` attribute [[HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bib-html)].

     Note 2Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.

     Note 3This criterion applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself. Since hidden components that are made visible on keyboard focus (such as links used to skip to another part of a page) do not present additional content they are not covered by this criterion.

## Details

- **Dismissible**: A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content;
- **Hoverable**: If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved  over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;
- **Persistent**: The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Making content on focus or hover hoverable, dismissible, and persistent**

**ARIA: Using role="tooltip" (Potential future technique)**

**CSS: Using hover and focus pseudo classes (Potential future technique)**


### Common Failures

- **F95**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.13 due to content shown on hover not being hoverable
- ****: Failure to make content dismissible without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus (Potential future technique)
- ****: Failure to meet by content on hover or focus not remaining visible until dismissed or invalid (Potential future technique)
