# 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA)

**Guideline**: 1.4 Distinguishable  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:

## Full Description

Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:

   

       - Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-css-pixels);

       - Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-css-pixels).

   

   Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.

  
  Note 1320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting [viewport](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-viewport) width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.

   
   Note 2Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content.

## Details

- ****: Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;
- ****: Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Using media queries and grid CSS to reflow columns**

**Using CSS Flexbox to reflow content**

**Allowing for Reflow with Long URLs and Strings of Text**

**Using CSS width, max-width and flexbox to fit labels and inputs**

**Calculating size and position in a way that scales with text size**

**Providing options within the content to switch to a layout that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text**

**Accounting for meaningful text indentation and Reflow**

**Section panels that scroll horizontally are designed to fit within a width of 320 CSS pixels on a vertically scrolling page**

**Using PDF/UA when creating PDFs (Potential future technique)**


### Advisory Techniques

- **C34**: Using media queries to un-fixing sticky headers / footers
- **C37**: Using CSS max-width and height to fit images
- ****: CSS, Reflowing simple data tables (Potential future technique)
- ****: CSS, Fitting data cells within the width of the viewport (Potential future technique)
- ****: Mechanism to allow mobile view at any time (Potential future technique)
- ****: Alternate view supporting Reflow for otherwise excepted content (Potential future technique)

### Common Failures

- **F102**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.10 due to content disappearing and not being available when content has reflowed
