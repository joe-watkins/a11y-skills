# 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum) (Level AA)

**Guideline**: 3.3 Input Assistance  
**Principle**: 3 Understandable

## Understanding

A cognitive function test (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step provides at least one of the following:

## Full Description

A [cognitive function test](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-cognitive-function-test) (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes) unless that step provides at least one of the following:

 
    

        **Alternative**: 
        Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.

        **Mechanism**: 
      A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.

        **Object Recognition**: 
        The cognitive function test is to recognize objects.

        **Personal Content**: 
      The cognitive function test is to identify [non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-non-text-content) the user provided to the website.

    

    Note 1"Object recognition" and "Personal content" may be represented by images, video, or audio.

    Note 2Examples of mechanisms that satisfy this criterion include:
        

            - support for password entry by password managers to reduce memory need, and

            - copy and paste to reduce the cognitive burden of re-typing.

## Details

- **Alternative**: Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.
- **Mechanism**: A mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.
- **Object Recognition**: The cognitive function test is to recognize objects.
- **Personal Content**: The cognitive function test is to identify non-text content the user provided to the website.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Email link authentication**

**Providing properly marked up email and password inputs**

**Providing WebAuthn as an alternative to username/password (Potential future technique)**

**Providing a third-party login using OAuth (Potential future technique)**

**Using two techniques to provide two-factor authentication (Potential future technique)**


### Common Failures

- **F109**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.3.8 and 3.3.9 due to preventing password or code re-entry in the same format
