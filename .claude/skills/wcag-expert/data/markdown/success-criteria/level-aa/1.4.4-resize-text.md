# 1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA)

**Guideline**: 1.4 Distinguishable  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.

## Full Description

Except for [captions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-captions) and [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-images-of-text), [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text) can be resized without [assistive technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-assistive-technologies) up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom**

**Providing controls on the web page that allow users to incrementally change the size of all text on the page up to 200 percent**

**Ensuring that there is no loss of content or functionality when the text resizes and text containers do not change their width**


### Advisory Techniques

- **C17**: Scaling form elements which contain text
- **C20**: Using relative measurements to set column widths so that lines can average 80 characters or less when the browser is resized
- **C22**: Using CSS to control visual presentation of text

### Common Failures

- **F69**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.4 when resizing visually rendered text up to 200 percent causes the text, image or controls to be clipped, truncated or obscured
- **F80**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.4 when text-based form controls do not resize when visually rendered text is resized up to 200%
- **F94**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.4 due to incorrect use of viewport units to resize text
