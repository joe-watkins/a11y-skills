# 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation (Level AA)

**Guideline**: 3.2 Predictable  
**Principle**: 3 Understandable

## Understanding

Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple web pages within a set of web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.

## Full Description

Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple [web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-web-page-s) within a [set of web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-set-of-web-pages) occur in the [same relative order](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-same-relative-order) each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Presenting repeated components in the same relative order each time they appear**


### Advisory Techniques

- **PDF14**: Providing running headers and footers in PDF documents
- **PDF17**: Specifying consistent page numbering for PDF documents

### Common Failures

- **F66**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.3 due to presenting navigation links in a different relative order on different pages
