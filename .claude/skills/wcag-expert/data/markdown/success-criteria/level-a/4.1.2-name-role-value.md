# 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)

**Guideline**: 4.1 Compatible  
**Principle**: 4 Robust

## Understanding

For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Full Description

For all [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components) (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts),
     the [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-name) and [role](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-role) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-programmatically-determinable); [states](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-states), properties, and values that can be set by the user can be [programmatically set](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-programmatically-set); and notification of changes to these items is available to [user agents](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents), including [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-assistive-technologies).
   

   
   NoteThis success criterion is primarily for web authors who develop or script their own
      user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success
      criterion when used according to specification.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Situation A: If using a standard user interface component in a markup language (e.g., HTML):**

- **ARIA14**: Using aria-label to provide an accessible name where a visible label cannot be used
- **ARIA16**: Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls
- **G108**: Using markup features to expose the name and role, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of changes
**Situation B: If using script or code to re-purpose a standard user interface component in a markup language:**

- ****: Exposing the names and roles, allowing user-settable properties to be directly set, and providing notification of changes
**Situation C: If using a standard user interface component in a programming technology:**

- **G135**: Using the accessibility API features of a technology to expose names and roles, to allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and to provide notification of changes
**Situation D: If creating your own user interface component in a programming language:**

- **G10**: Creating components using a technology that supports the accessibility API features of the platforms on which the user agents will be run to expose the names and roles, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of changes

### Common Failures

- **F59**: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to using script to make div or span a user interface control in HTML without providing a role for the control
- **F15**: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to implementing custom controls that do not use an accessibility API for the technology, or do so incompletely
- **F20**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 4.1.2 due to not updating text alternatives when changes to non-text content occur
- **F42**: Failure of Success Criteria 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.3, or 4.1.2 when emulating links
- **F68**: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to a user interface control not having a programmatically determined name
- **F79**: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to the focus state of a user interface component not being programmatically determinable or no notification of change of focus state available
- **F86**: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to not providing names for each part of a multi-part form field, such as a US telephone number
- **F89**: Failure of Success Criteria 2.4.4, 2.4.9 and 4.1.2 due to not providing an accessible name for an image which is the only content in a link
- **F111**: Failure of Success Criteria 1.3.1, 2.5.3, and 4.1.2 due to a control with visible label text but no accessible name
