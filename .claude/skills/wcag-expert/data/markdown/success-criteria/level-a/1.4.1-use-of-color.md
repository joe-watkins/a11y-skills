# 1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)

**Guideline**: 1.4 Distinguishable  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

## Full Description

Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an
      action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
   

   
   NoteThis success criterion addresses color perception specifically. Other forms of perception are covered in [Guideline 1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#adaptable) including programmatic access to color and other visual presentation coding.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Situation A: If the color of particular words, backgrounds, or other content is used to indicate information:**

- **G14**: Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text
- **G205**: Including a text cue for colored form control labels
- **G182**: Ensuring that additional visual cues are available when text color differences are used to convey information
- **G183**: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual cues on hover for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them
**Situation B: If color is used within an image to convey information:**

- **G111**: Using color and pattern
- **G14**: Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text

### Advisory Techniques

- **C15**: Using CSS to change the presentation of a user interface component when it receives focus

### Common Failures

- **F13**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.4.1 due to having a text alternative that does not include information that is conveyed by color differences in the image
- **F73**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.1 due to creating links that are not visually evident without color vision
- **F81**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.1 due to identifying required or error fields using color differences only
