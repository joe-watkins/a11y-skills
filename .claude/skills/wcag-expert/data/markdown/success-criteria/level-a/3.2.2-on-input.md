# 3.2.2 On Input (Level A)

**Guideline**: 3.2 Predictable  
**Principle**: 3 Understandable

## Understanding

Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component.

## Full Description

Changing the setting of any [user interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components) does not automatically cause a [change of context](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-change-of-context) unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Providing a submit button to initiate a change of context**

**Describing what will happen before a change to a form control that causes a change of context to occur is made**

**Using an onchange event on a select element without causing a change of context**


### Advisory Techniques

- **G201**: Giving users advanced warning when opening a new window

### Common Failures

- **F36**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.2 due to automatically submitting a form and presenting new content without prior warning when the last field in the form is given a value
- **F37**: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.2 due to launching a new window without prior warning when the selection of a radio button, check box or select list is changed
