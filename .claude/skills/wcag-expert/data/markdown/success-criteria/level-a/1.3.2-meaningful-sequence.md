**Guideline**: 1.3 Adaptable  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.

## Full Description

When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a [correct reading sequence](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-correct-reading-sequence) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-programmatically-determinable).

**Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence**
