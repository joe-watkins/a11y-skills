# 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.4 Navigable  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

If a web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.

## Full Description

If a [web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-web-page-s) can be [navigated sequentially](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-navigated-sequentially) and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive
      focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Placing the interactive elements in an order that follows sequences and relationships within the content**

**Giving focus to elements in an order that follows sequences and relationships within the content**

**Changing a web page dynamically**


### Common Failures

- **F44**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.3 due to using tabindex to create a tab order that does not preserve meaning and operability
- **F85**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.3 due to using dialogs or menus that are not adjacent to their trigger control in the sequential navigation order
