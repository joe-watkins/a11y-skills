# 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.1 Keyboard Accessible  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.

## Full Description

If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a [keyboard interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-keyboard-interface), then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface,
      and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit
      methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
   

   
   NoteSince any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to
      meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc5).

## Details


## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Ensuring that users are not trapped in content**


### Common Failures

- **F10**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.1.2 and Conformance Requirement 5 due to combining multiple content formats in a way that traps users inside one format type
