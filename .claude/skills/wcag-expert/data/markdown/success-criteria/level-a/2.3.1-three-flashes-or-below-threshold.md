# 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.

## Full Description

[Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-web-page-s) do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period,
      or the [flash](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-flashes) is below the [general flash and red flash thresholds](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds).
   

   
   NoteSince any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to
      meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc5).
