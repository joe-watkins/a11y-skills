# 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)

**Guideline**: 1.1 Text Alternatives  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

## Full Description

All [non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-non-text-content) that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text-alternative) that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.
   

   
   

      
      **Controls, Input**: 
      
      If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-name) that describes its purpose. (Refer to [Success Criterion 4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#name-role-value) for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)
         

         
      

      
      **Time-Based Media**: 
      
      If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive
            identification of the non-text content. (Refer to [Guideline 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#time-based-media) for additional requirements for media.)
         

         
      

      
      **Test**: 
      
      If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text
            content.
         

         
      

      
      **Sensory**: 
      
      If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-specific-sensory-experience), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text
            content.
         

         
      

      
      **[CAPTCHA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-captcha)**: 
      
      If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by
            a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe
            the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA
            using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate
            different disabilities.
         

         
      

      
      **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible**: 
      
      If non-text content is [pure decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-pure-decoration), is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented
            in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-assistive-technologies).

## Details

- **Controls, Input**: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)
- **Time-Based Media**: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)
- **Test**: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
- **Sensory**: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
- **CAPTCHA**: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
- **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible**: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

- **H86**: Providing text alternatives for emojis, emoticons, ASCII art, and leetspeak
- **PDF1**: Applying text alternatives to images with the Alt entry in PDF documents
**Situation B: If a short description can **not** serve the same purpose and present the same information as the non-text content (e.g., a chart or diagram):**

- **G95**: Providing short text alternatives that provide a brief description of the non-text content

*Short text alternative techniques for Situation B*

- **ARIA6**: Using aria-label to provide labels for objects

- ****: Providing a descriptive label
- **G68**: Providing a short text alternative that describes the purpose of live audio-only and live video-only content

*Techniques to indicate that text alternatives are not required for Situation F*

- **C9**: Using CSS to include decorative images
- **H67**: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that assistive technology should ignore
- **PDF4**: Hiding decorative images with the Artifact tag in PDF documents

### Advisory Techniques

- **C18**: Using CSS margin and padding rules instead of spacer images for layout design

### Common Failures

- **F3**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using CSS to include images that convey important information
- **F13**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.4.1 due to having a text alternative that does not include information that is conveyed by color differences in the image
- **F20**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 4.1.2 due to not updating text alternatives when changes to non-text content occur
- **F30**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to using text alternatives that are not alternatives (e.g., filenames or placeholder text)
- **F38**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to not marking up decorative images in HTML in a way that allows assistive technology to ignore them
- **F39**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to providing a text alternative that is not null (e.g., alt="spacer" or alt="image") for images that should be ignored by assistive technology
- **F65**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to omitting the alt attribute or text alternative on img elements, area elements, and input elements of type "image"
- **F67**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to providing long descriptions for non-text content that does not serve the same purpose or does not present the same information
- **F71**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using text look-alikes to represent text without providing a text alternative
- **F72**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using ASCII art without providing a text alternative
