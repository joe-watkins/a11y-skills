# 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.4 Navigable  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.

## Full Description

The [purpose of each link](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-purpose-of-each-link) can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its
      [programmatically determined link context](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-programmatically-determined-link-context), except where the purpose of the link would be [ambiguous to users in general](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-ambiguous-to-users-in-general).

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link**

**Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link for anchor elements**

**Providing text alternatives for the area elements of image maps**

**Allowing the user to choose short or long link text**

**Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with the text of the enclosing sentence**

**Providing a supplemental description of the purpose of a link**

**Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with programmatically determined link context**


### Advisory Techniques

- **H2**: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource
- **H80**: Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with the preceding heading element

### Common Failures

- **F63**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.4 due to providing link context only in content that is not related to the link
- **F89**: Failure of Success Criteria 2.4.4, 2.4.9 and 4.1.2 due to not providing an accessible name for an image which is the only content in a link
