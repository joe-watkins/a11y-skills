# 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)

**Guideline**: 1.3 Adaptable  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.

## Full Description

Information, [structure](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-structure), and [relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-relationships) conveyed through [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-programmatically-determinable) or are available in text.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Situation A: The technology provides semantic structure to make information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable:**

- **ARIA11**: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page
- **H101**: Using semantic HTML elements to identify regions of a page
- **ARIA12**: Using role=heading to identify headings
- **ARIA13**: Using aria-labelledby to name regions and landmarks
- **ARIA16**: Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls
- **ARIA17**: Using grouping roles to identify related form controls
- **ARIA20**: Using the region role to identify a region of the page
- ****: 
- **G117**: Using text to convey information that is conveyed by variations in presentation of text
- **G140**: Separating information and structure from presentation to enable different presentations
- **ARIA24**: Semantically identifying a font icon with role="img"
- ****: Making information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable
**Situation B: The technology in use does NOT provide the semantic structure to make the information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable:**

- **G117**: Using text to convey information that is conveyed by variations in presentation of text
- ****: Making information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable or available in text

### Advisory Techniques

- **C22**: Using CSS to control visual presentation of text
- **G162**: Positioning labels to maximize predictability of relationships
- **ARIA1**: Using the aria-describedby property to provide a descriptive label for user interface controls
- **ARIA2**: Identifying a required field with the aria-required property
- **G141**: Organizing a page using headings

### Common Failures

- **F2**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using changes in text presentation to convey information without using the appropriate markup or text
- **F33**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to create multiple columns in plain text content
- **F34**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to format tables in plain text content
- **F42**: Failure of Success Criteria 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.3, or 4.1.2 when emulating links
- **F43**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using structural markup in a way that does not represent relationships in the content
- **F46**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using th elements, caption elements, or non-empty summary attributes in layout tables
- **F48**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using the pre element to markup tabular information
- **F90**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 for incorrectly associating table headers and content via the headers and id attributes
- **F91**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 for not correctly marking up table headers
- **F92**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to the use of role presentation on content which conveys semantic information
- **F111**: Failure of Success Criteria 1.3.1, 2.5.3, and 4.1.2 due to a control with visible label text but no accessible name
