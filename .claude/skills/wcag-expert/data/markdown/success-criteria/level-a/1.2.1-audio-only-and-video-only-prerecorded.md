      **Prerecorded Audio-only**: 
      
      An [alternative for time-based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-alternative-for-time-based-media) is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded audio-only content.
         

         
      

      
      **Prerecorded Video-only**:

            equivalent information for prerecorded video-only content.

## Details

- **Prerecorded Audio-only**: An alternative for time-based media is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded audio-only content.
- **Prerecorded Video-only**: Either an alternative for time-based media or an audio track is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded video-only content.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Situation A: If the content is prerecorded audio-only:**

- **G158**: Providing an alternative for time-based media for audio-only content
**Situation B: If the content is prerecorded video-only:**

- **G159**: Providing an alternative for time-based media for video-only content
- **G166**: Providing audio that describes the important video content and describing it as such

### Advisory Techniques

- **H96**: Using the track element to provide audio descriptions

### Common Failures

- **F30**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to using text alternatives that are not alternatives (e.g., filenames or placeholder text)
- **F67**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to providing long descriptions for non-text content that does not serve the same purpose or does not present the same information
