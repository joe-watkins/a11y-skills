# 1.4.2 Audio Control (Level A)

**Guideline**: 1.4 Distinguishable  
**Principle**: 1 Perceivable

## Understanding

If any audio on a web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

## Full Description

If any audio on a web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to [pause](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-pause) or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio
      volume independently from the overall system volume level.
   

   
   NoteSince any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether or not it is used
      to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc5).

## Details


## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Playing a sound that turns off automatically within three seconds**

**Providing a control near the beginning of the web page that turns off sounds that play automatically**

**Playing sounds only on user request**


### Common Failures

- **F23**: Failure of 1.4.2 due to playing a sound longer than 3 seconds where there is no mechanism to turn it off
- **F93**: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.2 for absence of a way to pause or stop an HTML5 media element that autoplays
