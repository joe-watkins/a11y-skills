# 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.1 Keyboard Accessible  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.

## Full Description

All [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-functionality) of the content is operable through a [keyboard interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-keyboard-interface) without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying
      function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just
      the endpoints.
   

   
   Note 1This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example,
      if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent
      input but the underlying function (text input) does not.
   

   
   Note 2This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input
      methods in addition to keyboard operation.

## Details


## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Ensuring keyboard control for all functionality**

**Ensuring keyboard control**

**Providing keyboard-triggered event handlers**


### Advisory Techniques

- ****: 

### Common Failures

- **F54**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.1.1 due to using only pointing-device-specific event handlers (including gesture) for a function
- **F55**: Failure of Success Criteria 2.1.1, 2.4.7, 2.4.13, and 3.2.1 due to using script to remove focus when focus is received
- **F42**: Failure of Success Criteria 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.3, or 4.1.2 when emulating links
