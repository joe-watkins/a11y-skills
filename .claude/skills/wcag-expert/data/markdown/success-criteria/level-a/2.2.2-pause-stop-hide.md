# 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.2 Enough Time  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:

## Full Description

For moving, [blinking](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-blinking), scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:
   

   
   

      
      **Moving, blinking, scrolling**: 
      
      For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2)
            lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content,
           there is a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) for the user to [pause](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-pause), stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity
            where it is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential); and
         

         
      

      
      **Auto-updating**: 
      
      For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented
            in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop,
            or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part
            of an activity where it is essential.
         

         
      

      
   

   
   Note 1For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to [Guideline 2.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#seizures-and-physical-reactions).
   

   
   Note 2Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to
      meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc5).
   

   
   Note 3Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent
      is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between
      the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically
      possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.
   

   
   Note 4An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered
      essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating
      progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.

## Details

- **Moving, blinking, scrolling**: For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and
- **Auto-updating**: For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Allowing the content to be paused and restarted from where it was paused**

**Using script to scroll content, and providing a mechanism to pause it**

**Creating content that blinks for less than 5 seconds**

**Setting animated gif images to stop blinking after n cycles (within 5 seconds)**

**Using scripts to control blinking and stop it in five seconds or less**

**Using a control in the web page that stops moving, blinking, or auto-updating content**

**Providing a link, button, or other mechanism that reloads the page without any blinking content**


### Common Failures

- **F16**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to including scrolling content where movement is not essential to the activity without also including a mechanism to pause and restart the content
- **F112**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to using blinking content that lasts for more than five seconds without a mechanism to stop it
- **F50**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to a script that causes a blink effect without a mechanism to stop the blinking at 5 seconds or less
- **F7**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to an object or applet that has blinking content without a mechanism to pause the content that blinks for more than five seconds
