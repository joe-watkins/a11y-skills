# 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.5 Input Modalities  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:

## Full Description

[Functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-functionality) that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components) and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:

   
   

   
   **Supported Interface**: 
     The motion is used to operate functionality through an [accessibility supported](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-accessibility-supported) interface;

   
   **Essential**: 
   The motion is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential) for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity.

## Details

- **Supported Interface**: The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface;
- **Essential**: The motion is essential for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Provide conventional controls and an application setting for motion activated input**

**GXXX: Supporting system level features which allow the user to disable motion actuation**


### Common Failures

- **F106**: Failure due to inability to deactivate motion actuation
- ****: FXXX: Failure of Success Criterion 2.5.4 due to disrupting or disabling system level features which allow the user to disable motion actuation
