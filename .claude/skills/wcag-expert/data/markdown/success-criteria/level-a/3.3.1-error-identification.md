# 3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A)

**Guideline**: 3.3 Input Assistance  
**Principle**: 3 Understandable

## Understanding

If an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error is described to the user in text.

## Full Description

If an [input error](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-input-error) is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error
      is described to the user in text.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Situation A: If a form contains fields for which information from the user is mandatory.**

- **G83**: Providing text descriptions to identify required fields that were not completed
- **ARIA21**: Using aria-invalid to Indicate An Error Field
- **SCR18**: Providing client-side validation and alert
- **PDF5**: Indicating required form controls in PDF forms
**Situation B: If information provided by the user is required to be in a specific data format or of certain values.**

- **ARIA18**: Using aria-alertdialog to Identify Errors
- **ARIA19**: Using ARIA role=alert or Live Regions to Identify Errors
- **ARIA21**: Using aria-invalid to Indicate An Error Field
- **G84**: Providing a text description when the user provides information that is not in the list of allowed values
- **G85**: Providing a text description when user input falls outside the required format or values
- **SCR18**: Providing client-side validation and alert
- **SCR32**: Providing client-side validation and adding error text via the DOM
- **PDF22**: Indicating when user input falls outside the required format or values in PDF forms

### Advisory Techniques

- **G139**: Creating a mechanism that allows users to jump to errors
- **G199**: Providing success feedback when data is submitted successfully
- **ARIA2**: Identifying a required field with the aria-required property
