# 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.5 Input Modalities  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:

## Full Description

For [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-functionality) that can be operated using a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer), at least one of the following is true:

   					
   

   
   **No Down-Event**: 
     The [down-event](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-down-event) of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;

      						
   **Abort or Undo**: 
     Completion of the function is on the [up-event](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-up-event), and a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;

      						
   **Up Reversal**: 
     The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;

      						
   **Essential**: 
     Completing the function on the down-event is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential).

      						
   

   Note 1Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.

   					
  Note 2This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e., this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).

## Details

- **No Down-Event**: The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;
- **Abort or Undo**: Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;
- **Up Reversal**: The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;
- **Essential**: Completing the function on the down-event is essential.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Ensuring that drag-and-drop actions can be cancelled**

**Using native controls to ensure functionality is triggered on the up-event.**

**Touch events are only triggered when touch is removed from a control (Potential future technique)**


### Common Failures

- **F101**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.5.2 due to activating a control on the down-event
