# 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.2 Enough Time  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:

## Full Description

For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:

   
   

      
      **Turn off**: 
      
      The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or

         
      

      
      **Adjust**: 
      
      The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range
            that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
         

         
      

      
      **Extend**: 
      
      The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the
            time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user
            is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
         

         
      

      
      **Real-time Exception**: 
      
      The time limit is a required part of a [real-time event](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-real-time-events) (for example, an auction),
            and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
         

         
      

      
      **Essential Exception**: 
      
      The time limit is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential) and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
         

         
      

      
      **20 Hour Exception**: 
      
      The time limit is longer than 20 hours.

         
      

      
   

   
   NoteThis success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected
      changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion
      should be considered in conjunction with [Success Criterion 3.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#on-focus), which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.

## Details

- **Turn off**: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
- **Adjust**: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
- **Extend**: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
- **Real-time Exception**: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
- **Essential Exception**: The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
- **20 Hour Exception**: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.

## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Situation A: If there are session time limits:**

- **G133**: Providing a checkbox on the first page of a multipart form that allows users to ask for longer session time limit or no session time limit
- **G198**: Providing a way for the user to turn the time limit off
**Situation B: If a time limit is controlled by a script on the page:**

- **G198**: Providing a way for the user to turn the time limit off
- **G180**: Providing the user with a means to set the time limit to 10 times the default time limit
- ****: 
**Situation C: If there are time limits on reading:**

- **G4**: Allowing the content to be paused and restarted from where it was paused
- **G198**: Providing a way for the user to turn the time limit off
- **SCR33**: Using script to scroll content, and providing a mechanism to pause it
- **SCR36**: Providing a mechanism to allow users to display moving, scrolling, or auto-updating text in a static window or area

### Common Failures

- **F40**: Failure due to using meta redirect with a time limit
- **F41**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1, 2.2.4, and 3.2.5 due to using meta refresh to reload the page
- **F58**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1 due to using server-side techniques to automatically redirect pages after a time-out
