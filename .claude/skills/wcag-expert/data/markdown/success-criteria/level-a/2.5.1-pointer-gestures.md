# 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (Level A)

**Guideline**: 2.5 Input Modalities  
**Principle**: 2 Operable

## Understanding

All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.

## Full Description

All [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-functionality) that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential).

   					
   NoteThis requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e., this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).

## Details


## Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

**Providing controls to achieve the same result as path based or multipoint gestures**

**Providing single point activation for a control slider**


### Common Failures

- **F105**: Failure of Success Criterion 2.5.1 due to providing functionality via a path-based gesture without simple pointer alternative
